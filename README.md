# 👋 Welcome to the Osmanbeyoglu Lab

We are a computational biology research group at the University of Pittsburgh dedicated to developing and applying AI- and data-driven approaches to better understand complex biological systems and human disease.<br><br>
Our research aims to uncover mechanistic and predictive insights into disease processes—particularly in cancer and complex conditions such as end-stage liver disease—by integrating multi-modal omics data with advanced machine learning and statistical modeling. Ultimately, we seek to translate this knowledge into actionable strategies for precision medicine and therapeutic development.<br><br>
To support these efforts, we build robust computational tools and frameworks, primarily using R and Python, and work in close collaboration with experimental and clinical researchers.<br><br>
